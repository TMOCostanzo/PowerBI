Nikhil,

I'm letting you know that the payroll department has finally figured things out with my pay and is now withholding all of my pay until the overpayment has been taken care of. 

Stephen told me that you needed specific information from the payroll/HR department so you could get State Farm to get the unpaid wages provided to him. To that end, I'm including the person that I've been working with on this. Marivic may be able to point you to the correct person/department to get the required information.

Marivic, 

Can you please provide the attorney with any information that they need regarding my unpaid time. If you can't could you please point them to the correct group?

Thanks a ton for getting this all cleared up - i know it took a bunch of your time to navigate this really confusing situation with the software and pay.
